# Bicycle Theft Prediction API

This project is a group assignment for COMP309, where we develop a predictive machine learning model to classify whether a stolen bicycle is likely to be returned or not. The model is deployed as an API, with a frontend interface built using React.

## ðŸ“‹ Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

1. **Data Exploration**: Load, clean, visualize, and analyze a dataset of bicycle thefts in Toronto.
2. **Data Modeling**: Prepare the dataset by transforming, selecting, and managing features for effective prediction.
3. **Predictive Model Building**: Create and evaluate supervised machine learning classifiers using Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy.
4. **API Deployment**: Use Flask to deploy the trained model as a RESTful API.
5. **Frontend Development**: Build a React-based web application to interact with the API and provide predictions.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Data Exploration**: Statistical analysis, visualizations, and insights into the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and other classification algorithms.
- **Model Evaluation**: Confusion matrix, ROC curves, and performance metrics.
- **API Service**: Exposes the predictive model for external use with serialization/deserialization via Pickle.
- **Frontend Interface**: React-based UI for easy interaction with the API.
